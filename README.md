# Three-Dimensional-Data-Visualization
In this project a modified version of three dimensional data visualiziation is developed. This graphical technique is used for representing a 3-dimensional surface and to show the relationship between two independent variables and one dependent variable. The graph displays Z variable values for various X and Y variable combinations.
